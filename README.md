| -------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |

### Installing Node.js from binaries

Visit [https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) and download the "Linux Binaries" download and copy it to a folder

Then add Node.js to your path (replace "Node.js_folder" with the location of the bin folder in the folder you installed Node.js in  
`echo -e '\nexport PATH=Node.js_folder:$PATH' >> ~/.profile && source ~/.profile`



### Updating NPM

Now you need to update NPM  
`npm install -g npm`



### Installing Angular using NPM

Now you need to install Angular globally  
`npm install -g @angular/cli@latest`



### Updating node_modules for X-CASH Proof of Stake - Shared Delegates Website

Now you need to install all of the dependicies for the website. Navigate to the folder with the package.json file, and then run  
`npm update`



### NGINX Setup

Now you need to setup nginx so it will act as a reverse proxy to the website server. This will also allow you to setup SSL for the website if you want.

First install nginx  
`sudo apt install nginx`

Next setup the sites avaible. You can use the default file if just hosting one website on the server, or you can make another file if you need to host multiple websites on the server. The location of the files are at `/etc/nginx/sites-available`

A default setup for a non SSL website hosting one website, would look similar to this  
```
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name YOUR_DOMANIN_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER;

        location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

Now create an html folder for the website. If you are going to host one website on the server, you can use the default html folder located at `/var/www/html` otherwise you will need to make another html folder inside a website named folder. For exampel `/var/www/YOUR_DOMANIN_NAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER/html`
