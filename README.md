# XCASH_DPOPS - Shared Delegates Website

Forked from [cdk-admin](https://github.com/codetok/cdk-admin), an Angular 6 admin panel using angular material & angular flex.




## Introduction

This website will give users
* A dashboard that will show how to vote for the delegate, the delegate fee, and how many blocks the delegate has found
* A place to view a detailed list of the blocks found by the delegate
* A place to view how many votes the delegate has and what public addresses, with their reserve proofs have voted for the delegate
* A place to view how many payments and how much X-CASH the delegate has paid
* A place to view how much X-CASH a user has earned from staking with the delegate

This website is for delegates that are planning to get elected by others voting for them. It provides an automatic way to pay users that have voted for you, and provides them an automatic way for them to view their payment history.
This website is not needed for a solo delegate.

**If you plan on running a shared delegates website or a delegates website, you will need to run the website on the same system as the DPOPS node**
